## Purpose

The main goal of **breakwater** is to support the designer in exploring different
types of breakwaters, see Figure 1.1 for a cross section of the breakwater
types defined by CIRIA, CUR, CETMEF (2007). The main use case is thus to make a
conceptual design of a breakwater using one of the design classes, see [Chapter 7]
of the documentation. However, because all functions and classes are also available
from `breakwater.core` it is also possible to develop your own design automation
script.

###### Note
> Due to the limited time not all breakwater types defined by CIRIA, CUR, CETMEF (2007)
  could be implemented. Currently only the following structures have been implemented:
  conventional rubble mound breakwaters with rock and armour units as armour layer,
  caisson breakwaters and vertically composite breakwaters.

## Main Features

**breakwater** offers the following features to support the designer:

- Design a rubble mound breakwater with rock or concrete armour units as armour
  layer, with `bw.RockRubbleMound` or `bw.ConcreteRubbleMound`.
- Design a vertical or vertically composite breakwater with `bw.Caisson`.
- Design with an interactive design application by using `bw.interactive_design`.
  With this application several parameters can be changed with sliders, to assess
  the influence of certain parameters on the design and cost.
- Design multiple breakwaters at ones by using `bw.Configurations`. With this class
  multiple breakwater types can be designed at ones, these concepts can than
  be assess by using a multi-criteria analysis or with the [DesignExplorer].
- Use the functions and classes from `breakwater.core` to create your own
  design automation approach. `breakwater.core` consist of all functions and
  classes defined in Chapters [8] to [11].

## Getting Started

The latest released version is available at the Van Oord [Python package index]

```sh
pip install breakwater
```

Alternatively, the source code can be downloaded, or cloned, from the GitHub repository.  

To install this package in a anaconda environment in developer mode please follow steps below after opening a terminal in Anaconda:
1. `conda create --name nameofyournewenvironment python=3.8 --no-default-packages`
2. `source activate nameofyournewenvironment` ; 
3. `conda install jupyter pip`
4. `pip install --upgrade pip`
5. Navigate to the local repository of the coastal-tools and then run `pip install -e .`


A tutorial of **breakwater** can be found in [Chapter 3] of the documentation. This
[documentation] also provides a full overview of the implemented failure mechanisms,
and is thus a full overview of all features of **breakwater**.
